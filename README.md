# FakeNews-Tracker
## Yi-Huai Chang
## Description
This project will focus on visualizing the spread of fake news and misinformation across different regions, leveraging data from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). The goal is to analyze how misinformation propagates geographically and over time, identifying which regions and topics are most affected. The project will utilize GDELT's theme tagging to isolate news articles related to fake news, misinformation, conspiracy theories, and related topics.

Through interactive maps and time series visualizations, this project aims to provide insights into the hotspots of misinformation, and track its spread globally. Understanding the patterns of fake news dissemination is crucial for addressing its societal impacts, particularly in areas such as public health, politics, and social cohesion.

## Likely Data Scource
### 1. Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT)
#### URL: 
[GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html)
#### Description: 
GDELT monitors and compiles global news reports, translating them from multiple languages, and categorizes them by themes, including fake news, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. The database provides real-time data on the geographic spread of these themes, along with sentiment analysis and the tone of coverage.

#### Estimated observations: 
Millions of rows, with 15-20 columns. Key columns include event ID, date, location, theme (e.g., "fake news," "misinformation"), tone, and source URL. Due to the large volume of data, the analysis will be limited to the most recent 10 years of observations.
